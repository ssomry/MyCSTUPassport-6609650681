        <p>It was the orientation day for the Faculty of Science at Thammasat University, held on August 8th. During the event, there were explanations about the fundamental studies within the faculty, discussions about educational pathways, and information about various schedules within the university, including internships in the fourth year.
        Experienced senior students provided guidance on different work methods. It was an interesting day where we gained a lot of knowledge and insights.</p>
