        <p>The first-year student orientation, held on August 5th, was a day filled with a wide range of activities. On that day, students had the opportunity to engage in various activities, including attending an assembly to watch a performance organized by senior students. Additionally, a special guest, Mr. Pitha, a politician, was invited to speak and share insights with the attendees.
        Lunch was provided free of charge, and in the afternoon, there were team-building activities and informative sessions about university life. It was a fun-filled day that provided both enjoyment and valuable knowledge to the new students.</p>
