        <p>It was a day when I had the chance to meet my fellow students from the same major for the first time. This event was organized by our senior students within the major. The activities included recreational games, discussions about further studies within the major, and sharing experiences related to coding.
        During the midday break, a complimentary lunch was provided for all participants. In the afternoon, we engaged in various group activities with our friends. It was a great experience, and we had a lot of fun <3.</p>
